# Hi there! 👋

My name is **Juan agustin Savoy**. I'm a Full Stack Developer (secretly in love with... back end developing). Currently working as a freelance Front-End Developer. Also a Photographer, Fimmaker and Drone operator.

👨‍💻 A dynamic and ambitious person. Really passionate about learning & teaching, searching always for things to challenge myself, and never stop growing.

✨Bridging the gap between design and development. From photography to programming - I began my coding journey by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I then attended SoyHenry, a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Coming from a creative background, I have always been drawn to the Front End. I enjoy CSS, design thinking, UX, and working with design systems.✨

🧙‍♂️ When not coding or shooting some frames (rarely), I'm always at gym.

👾 Curious fact: I'm a BIG fan of the 80s and 90s Cyberpunk aesthetic...
